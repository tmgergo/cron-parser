## Notes

Build:

`./gradlew jar`

Run:

`java -jar ./build/libs/cron-parser-1.0.jar`

`cat ./test_config/example_config.txt | java -jar ./build/libs/cron-parser-1.0.jar`

## Assumptions
- all times in the task config are in 24h format
- the separator between the minute, the hour and the command can be one or multiple whitespaces
- commands have reasonable length and word count
- simulated current time has leading 0s (e.g. "03:27" and not "3:27")
- output: only minutes are padded with zeros

## Requirements

We have a set of tasks, each running at least daily, which are scheduled with a simplified cron. We want to find when each of them will next run.

The scheduler config looks like this:
```
30 1 /bin/run_me_daily
45 * /bin/run_me_hourly
* * /bin/run_me_every_minute
* 19 /bin/run_me_sixty_times
```

The first field is the minutes past the hour, the second field is the hour of the day and the third is the command to run.

For both cases * means that it should run for all values of that field.

In the above example `run_me_daily` has been set to run at 1:30am every day and `run_me_hourly` at 45 minutes past the hour every hour.

The fields are whitespace separated and each entry is on a separate line.

We want you to write a command line program that when fed this config to `stdin` and the simulated 'current time' in the format `HH:MM` as command line argument outputs the soonest time at which each of the commands will fire and whether it is today or tomorrow.

When the task should fire at the simulated 'current time' then that is the time you should output, not the next one.

For example given the above examples as input and the simulated 'current time' command-line argument 16:10 the output should be:
```
1:30 tomorrow - /bin/run_me_daily
16:45 today - /bin/run_me_hourly
16:10 today - /bin/run_me_every_minute
19:00 today - /bin/run_me_sixty_times
```
